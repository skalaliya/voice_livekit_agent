**Tips for Better Results:**

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "Tell me about space", try "What causes stars to shine?"
2. **Ask Follow-ups**: The agent remembers context, so you can ask "Tell me more" or "Can you simplify that?"
3. **Request Detail Levels**: Say "explain simply" or "give me a detailed explanation"
4. **Combine Questions**: "Compare X and Y" or "What's the difference between A and B?"
5. **Use Tools**: The agent will automatically use calculator, converter, weather, etc. when appropriate

**Memory Feature:**
```
"Remember that I prefer metric units"
"What are my preferences?"
"Remember I'm learning Python"
```

The agent will recall these preferences in future conversations!
